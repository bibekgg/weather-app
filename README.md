# WeatherApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.1.

## Development server
Run `npm install --force` to install the dependecies. Use `--force` since [@angular/flex-layout](https://github.com/angular/flex-layout) is yet to support Angular v14

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
